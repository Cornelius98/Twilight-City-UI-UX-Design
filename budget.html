                                Supported the development of community budgets as a means of
                                improving local outcomes. Throughout 2010, Essex County Council (ECC) worked with
                                local partners to develop credible community budget proposals and, at in CSR 2010 the
                                county was selected as a pilot area for community budgets focused on families with multiple
                                problems. Since then, local partners have developed their community budgets work through
                                the EssexFamily project and by preparing proposals to pilot a whole place community
                                budget. At the time of submission, the Essex bid has been included on a short-list of
                                possible pilot areas.
                                Based on our experience to date, and our ongoing work to develop the Community Budget
                                concept, the points we wish to raise with the Committee are as follows:
